# MatrixWorld

Matrix world is a way of dealing with matrices. Matrix World comes with a bunch of functionality such as adding to matrices together, multiplying, deviding, and
subtracting them.

This library is also used for visualising the matrix either in the terminal or with a GUI. You will be accompanied by some graphs that can compare two matrices using
differnt parameters on what it will measure.

There will be more features added as time continues.
